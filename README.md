# CS599-MachineLearning

This repository for sharing the project work done for this course.

In Project1 we implement the least angle regression algorithm for computing the complete lasso path for given input data.

In particular we are computing the lasso path for prostate cancer data in package faraway.

The file Project1/lasso.R contains the code that implments the least angle regression algorithm and plots the lasso path.

The make file contains all the necessay commands to run the code and plot the figure.

To redo the analysis just run make on the command line.
